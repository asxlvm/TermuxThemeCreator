# Termux Terminal Theme Creator [WIP]

> Idea by [Infu](http://infu.fyi), thanks :)

# This app is a WIP

## What is this?
This repository is for an application I'm developing where you will have the option to create your own Termux color scheme and you will not need to use the prebuilt ones in Termux:Styling!

## TODO
- [ ] Releases page with `.apk`s built with Buildozer
- [ ] App layout
- [ ] Color picker with possible HEX input
- [ ] Export button
- [ ] Previews of theme
- [ ] Clickable color buttons that show color picker
